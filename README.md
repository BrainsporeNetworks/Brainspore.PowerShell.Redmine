Native Powershell Redmine Bindings

After being Unsatisfied with the existing Powershell Redmine Bindings being out of date, being a wrapper for a custom DLL, or straight not working, I've decided to build my own. This is my first PowerShell full module so any critiques are welcome. I would much prefer any commercial users pay for the work I've put into this.
